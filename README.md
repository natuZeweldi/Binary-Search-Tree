# Binary-Search-Tree-Implementation

README

Natnael Zeweldi

The work was completed using clion and has been unit tested on the terminal
in a private server (ssh) that Sonoma State University offers for students for
education purposes. Please refer to the cpp file for documentation on the purpose
of each function. I am also looking to add more functions that I have already
completed to showcase the capability of the implementation.
